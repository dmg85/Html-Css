  <title>Inline vs Block</title>

  <h2>Block elements</h2>
  <p style="border: blue 2px solid;">In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. The vertical distance between two sibling boxes is determined by the 'margin' properties. Vertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a block formatting context collapse.</p>
  <h2>Inline elements</h2>
  <p style="border: blue 2px solid;">Inline elements display one after the other in the direction that sentences run in that particular writing mode. While we don't tend to think of inline elements as having a box, as with everything in CSS they do. These inline boxes are arranged one after the other. If there is not enough space in the containing block for all of the boxes a box can break onto a new line. The lines created are known as line boxes.</p>
