		<h1>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</h1>
		<p>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries. Sass has been actively supported for about 17 years by its loving Core Team.</p>

		<h1>Sass Basics</h1>
		<p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that don&#39;t exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.</p>

		<h1>Variables</h1>
		<p>Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you&#39;ll want to reuse. Sass uses the &#36; symbol to make something a variable. Here&#39;s an example:</p>
		<a href="#page2" class="btn">
			Prev Page <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i>
		</a>
		<a href="#page4" class="btn">
			Prev Page <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i>
		</a>

		<h1>Nesting</h1>
		<p>When writing HTML you&#39;ve probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t.</p>
		<p>Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over&#45;qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
